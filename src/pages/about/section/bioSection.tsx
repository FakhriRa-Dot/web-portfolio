        I am a Bachelor of Informatics student at the University of Bengkulu
        with a strong interest in web development, particularly front-end
        development. I am familiar with using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind
        CSS, Bootstrap, and React to build interactive and responsive
        interfaces.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
        During my studies, I gained experience creating several web-based
        information systems, which helped me understand the application
        development process from design to implementation. I enjoy learning new
        technologies and continually honing my technical skills to contribute to
        projects with real impact.
